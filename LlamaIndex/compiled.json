Futures contracts are a true hedge investment and are most\nunderstandable when considered in terms of\n[commodities](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/commodity.asp) like corn or\noil. For instance, a farmer may want to lock in an acceptable crop price in\ncase market prices fall before the crop can be delivered. The buyer also wants\nto lock in a price to protect against a subsequent rise in prices.\n\n###  Examples\n\nLet's demonstrate with an example. Assume two\n[traders](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/t\/trader.asp) agree to a $7 per\nbushel price on a corn futures contract. If the price of corn moves up to $9,\nthe buyer of the contract makes $2 per bushel. The seller, on the other hand,\nloses out on a better deal.\n\nThe market for futures has expanded greatly beyond oil and corn. Futures can\nbe purchased on an index like the [S&P\n500](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/sp500.asp), and on individual stocks\nin some jurisdictions. (Single-stock futures have not been available in the\nU.S. since 2020.) Buyers of a futures contract are not required to pay the\nfull value of the contract up front. Instead, they cover a percentage of the\nprice as an [initial\nmargin](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/initialmargin.asp).\n\nFor example, an oil futures contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil. An agreement\nto buy an oil futures contract at $100 requires the buyer to risk $100,000.\nThe buyer may be required to pay several thousand dollars up front, and may be\nrequired to increase that commitment later if oil prices subsequently drop.\n\n###\n\nFutures markets primarily serve [institutional\ninvestors](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/institutionalinvestor.asp).\nThese may include refiners seeking to hedge crude costs or cattle producers\nseeking to lock in feed prices.\n\n###  Who Trades Futures?\n\nFutures markets serve commodity producers, commodity consumers, and\nspeculators. Futures contracts can protect buyers as well as sellers from wide\nprice [swings](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/swing.asp) in the\nunderlying commodity.\n\nThey also cater to institutional as well as retail traders seeking to profit\nfrom expected changes in market prices for the [underlying\nsecurity](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/u\/underlying-security.asp) or\ncommodity. Financial speculators typically don't intend to acquire the\nunderlying commodity when the contract is settled, and are likely to sell\ntheir position beforehand.\n\n###\n\nFutures trading hours may differ from stock and options markets. Normal\ntrading hours are often 8:30a.m.\u20133:00p.m., with electronic trading on the\nCME's [Globex](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/g\/globex.asp) platform\novernight from 5:00p.m.\u20138:30a.m. CT. Some futures products trade 24-hours a\nday on Globex.\n\n##  Key Differences\n\nAside from the differences noted above, there are other things that set\noptions and futures apart. Here are some other major differences between these\ntwo financial instruments.\n\n###  Options\n\nBecause they tend to be fairly complex, options contracts tend to be risky.\nCall and put options can be equally risky. When an investor buys a stock\noption, its risk is defined by its cost or premium. In the worst-case\nscenario, the option premium spent will be a total loss if the options expire\nworthless.\n\nHowever, selling a put option exposes the seller to a loss potentially much\nlarger than the premium gained from a possible decline in the value of the\nshares underlying the stock option. If a put option gives the buyer the right\nto sell the [stock](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/stock.asp) at $50 per\nshare but the stock falls to $10, the seller remains on the hook to purchase\nthe stock at $50 per share.\n\nThe risk to the buyer of an option is limited to the premium paid upfront.\n\n[ Corporate Bonds ](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0612\/how-to-invest-in-corporate-bonds.aspx)\n  6.

An options contract\ngives an investor the right to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a\nspecific price while the contract is in effect. Investors may choose not to\n[exercise](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/exercise.asp) their options.\n\nOptions are financial derivatives. Option holders do not own the underlying\nshares or enjoy shareholder rights unless they exercise an option to buy\nstock.\n\nOptions contracts for stocks typically provide the right to buy or sell 100\nshares of the stock at the specified [strike\nprice](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/strikeprice.asp) before the\ncontract expiration date, and the price of the option is known as its\n[premium](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/premium.asp).\n\n###\n\nIn the U.S., the equity options market is open from 9:30am - 4:00pm EST; the\nsame as normal stock trading hours. Options exchanges are also closed on\nholidays when stock exchanges are closed.\n\n###  Types of Options: Call and Put Options\n\nThere are only two kinds of options: [Call\noptions](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/calloption.asp) and [put\noptions](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/putoption.asp). A call option\nconfers the right to buy a stock at the strike price before the agreement\nexpires. A put option gives the holder the right to sell a stock at a specific\nprice.\n\nLet's look at an example of each\u2014first of a call option. An investor buys a\ncall option to buy stock XYZ at a $50 [strike\nprice](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/active-trading\/021014\/options-\nbasics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp) sometime within the next three months.\nThe stock is currently trading at $49. If the stock jumps to $60, the call\nbuyer can exercise the right to buy the stock at $50. That buyer can then\nimmediately sell the stock for $60 for a $10 profit per share.\n\n###  Other Possibilities\n\nAlternatively, the option buyer can simply sell the call and pocket the\n[profit](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/profit.asp), since the call\noption is worth $10 per share. If the option is trading below $50 at the time\nthe contract expires, the option is worthless. The call buyer loses the\nupfront payment for the option, called the premium.\n\nMeanwhile, if an investor owns a put option to sell XYZ at $100, and XYZ\u2019s\nprice falls to $80 before the option expires, the investor will gain $20 per\nshare, minus the cost of the premium. If the price of XYZ is above $100 at\n[expiration](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/expirationdate.asp), the\noption is worthless and the investor loses the premium paid upfront.\n\nEither the put buyer or the writer can close out their option position to lock\nin a profit or loss at any time before its expiration. This is done by buying\nthe option, in the case of the writer, or selling the option, in the case of\nthe buyer. The put buyer may also choose to exercise the right to sell at the\nstrike price.\n\n##  Futures\n\nA [futures](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/futures.asp) contract is the\nobligation to sell or buy an asset [at a later\ndate](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/how-to-trade-futures-5214571) at an agreed-\nupon price.

For instance, a farmer may want to lock in an acceptable crop price in\ncase market prices fall before the crop can be delivered.

        "context": "Often called the price or earnings multiple, the\nP\/E ratio helps assess the relative value of a company's stock. It's handy for\ncomparing a company's valuation against its historical performance, against\nother firms within its industry, or the overall market.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n  * The price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio is the proportion of a company's share price to its earnings per share.\n  * A high P\/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates.\n  * Companies with no earnings or are losing money don't have a P\/E ratio because there's nothing to put in the denominator.\n  * The two most used P\/E ratios are forward and trailing P\/E.\n  * P\/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies in the same industry or for a single company over time.\n\n![Price-to-Earnings \\(P\/E\\)\nRatio](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/thmb\/t8ItDCoGCS7EenwsNpM9cD8iKGk=\/1500x0\/filters:no_upscale\\(\\):max_bytes\\(150000\\):strip_icc\\(\\)\/Price-\nto-EarningsRatio_final-23bff9e93e624fdea7eb34ec993ea8a9.png)\n\nInvestopedia \/ Xiaojie Liu\n\n##  Understanding the P\/E Ratio\n\nThe P\/E ratio is one of the most widely used by investors and analysts\nreviewing a stock's relative valuation. It helps to determine whether a stock\nis overvalued or undervalued. A company's P\/E can also be benchmarked against\nother stocks in the same industry or against the broader market, such as the\nS&P 500 Index.\n\nAnalysts interested in long-term valuation trends can look at the P\/E 10 or\nP\/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or 30 years of earnings. These\nmeasures are often used when trying to gauge the overall value of a stock\nindex, such as the S&P 500, because these longer-term metrics can show overall\nchanges through several [business\ncycles](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/businesscycle.asp).\n\nThe P\/E ratio of the S&P 500 going back to 1927 has had a low of roughly 6 in\nmid-1949 and been as high as 122 in mid-2009, right after the financial\ncrisis. As of April 2024, the S&P 500's P\/E ratio was 26.26.\n\n##  P\/E Ratio Formula and Calculation\n\nThe formula and calculation are as follows:\n\nP\/E Ratio  =  Market value per share  Earnings per share  \\text{P\/E Ratio} =\n\\frac{\\text{Market value per share}}{\\text{Earnings per share}}  P\/E\nRatio=Earnings per shareMarket value per share\u200b\n\nTo [determine the P\/E\nvalue](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/070314\/how-do-i-calculate-pe-\nratio-company.asp), divide the stock price by the EPS.\n\nThe stock price (P) can be found simply by searching a stock\u2019s ticker on a\nreputable financial website. Although this concrete value reflects what\ninvestors currently pay for the stock, the EPS is related to earnings reported\nat different times.\n\nEPS is generally given in two ways. Trailing 12 months (TTM) represents the\ncompany's performance over the past 12 months. Another is found in earnings\nreleases, which often provide EPS guidance. This is the company's advice on\nwhat it expects in future earnings. These different versions of EPS form the\nbasis of trailing and forward P\/E, respectively.  \n\n### When to Review the P\/E Ratio\n\nAnalysts and investors review a company's P\/E ratio to determine if the share\nprice accurately represents the projected earnings per share.\n\n##  Forward Price-to-Earnings\n\nThe most commonly used P\/E ratios are the [forward\nP\/E](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/forwardpe.asp) and the trailing P\/E.\nA third and less typical variation uses the sum of the last two actual\nquarters and the estimates of the following two quarters.\n\nThe forward (or leading) P\/E uses future earnings guidance rather than\ntrailing figures. Sometimes called \"estimated price to earnings,\" this\nforward-looking indicator helps compare current earnings to future earnings\nand can clarify what earnings will look like without changes and other\naccounting adjustments.\n\nHowever, there are problems with the forward P\/E metric\u2014namely, companies\ncould underestimate earnings to beat the estimated P\/E when the next quarter's\nearnings arrive. Furthermore, external analysts may also provide estimates\nthat diverge from the company estimates, creating confusion.\n\nThe relative P\/E shows what\nportion or percentage of the past P\/Es that the current P\/E has reached. The\nrelative P\/E usually compares the current P\/E value with the highest value of\nthe range. Investors might also compare the current P\/E to the bottom side of\nthe range, measuring how close the current P\/E is to the historic low.\n\nThe relative P\/E will have a value below 100% if the current P\/E is lower than\nthe past value (whether the past is high or low). If the relative P\/E measure\nis 100% or more, this tells investors that the current P\/E has reached or\nsurpassed the past value.\n\n##  Limitations of Using the P\/E Ratio\n\nLike any other fundamental metric, the price-to-earnings ratio comes with a\nfew [limitations](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/070214\/how-can-\npricetoearnings-pe-ratio-mislead-investors.asp) that are important to\nunderstand. Companies that aren't profitable and have no earnings\u2014or negative\nearnings per share\u2014pose a challenge for calculating P\/E. Views among analysts\nvary about how to deal with this. Some say there is a negative P\/E, others\nassign a P\/E of 0, while most just say the P\/E doesn't exist (N\/A) until a\ncompany becomes profitable.\n\nA main limitation of using P\/E ratios is for comparing the P\/E ratios of\ncompanies from varied sectors. Companies' valuation and growth rates often\nvary wildly between industries because of how and when the firms earn their\nmoney.\n\nAs such, one should only use P\/E as a comparative tool when considering\ncompanies in the same sector because this is the only kind that will provide\nworthwhile results. For example, comparing the [P\/E ratios of a retail\ncompany](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/071615\/what-average-\npricetoearnings-ratio-retail-sector.asp) and the [P\/E of an oil and gas\ndrilling company](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/012015\/what-\naverage-pricetoearnings-ratio-oil-gas-drilling-sector.asp) could suggest one\nis the superior investment, but that's not a cogent conclusion. An individual\ncompany\u2019s high P\/E ratio, for example, would be less cause for concern when\nthe [entire sector has high P\/E\nratios](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/071015\/what-average-\npricetoearnings-ratio-food-and-beverage-sector.asp).\n\n##  Other P\/E Considerations\n\nBecause a company\u2019s debt can affect both share price and earnings,\n[leverage](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/l\/leverage.asp) can skew P\/E\nratios as well. For example, suppose two similar companies differ in the debt\nthey hold. The firm with more debt will likely have a lower P\/E value than the\none with less debt. However, if the business is solid, the one with more debt\ncould have higher earnings because of the risks it has taken.\n\nAnother critical limitation of price-to-earnings ratios lies within the\nformula for calculating P\/E. P\/E ratios rely on accurately presenting the\nmarket value of shares and earnings per share estimates. The market determines\nthe prices of shares available in many places. However, the source of earnings\ninformation is the company itself. Thus, it\u2019s possible it could be\nmanipulated, so analysts and investors have to trust the company\u2019s officers to\nprovide genuine information. The stock will be considered riskier and less\nvaluable if that trust is broken.\n\nTo reduce these risks, the P\/E ratio is only one measurement analyst's review.\nIf a company were to manipulate its results intentionally, it would be\nchallenging to ensure all the metrics were aligned in how they were changed.\nThat\u2019s why the P\/E ratio continues to be a central data point when analyzing\npublic companies, though by no means is it the only one.\n\n##  Alternatives to P\/E Ratios\n\nWhile the P\/E ratio is a commonly used metric, you can also use several other\nalternatives. One such alternative is the price-to-book (P\/B) ratio. This\nratio compares a company's market value to its book value. The book value\nrepresents the company's net asset value according to its balance sheet. The\nP\/B ratio is particularly useful for industries with substantial tangible\nassets, and a lower P\/B ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued.\n\nAnother alternative is the price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio which compares a\ncompany's stock price to its revenues.[ Price-to-Earnings Ratio ](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/fundamental-analysis\/10\/should-you-trust-pe-ratios.asp)\n  2.
