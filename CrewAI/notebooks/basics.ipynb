Presented forecast results and methodology to stakeholders (Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, and Senior Management members) across the Public Service. These forecasts were used across the Public Service for planning and climate change policy decision-making.\\n\\n# JOBTECH PTE LTD – Singapore  \\n**Apr 2017 - Aug 2017**\\n\\n### Data Scientist\\n- Coded JobTech’s Skill Extraction Algorithm using NLP techniques (regular expression) to construct skills graphs from the labour market through job descriptions on online job portals. The algorithm was used for a national job scan of Indonesia, with findings published in a report.\\n\\n# TOYOTA TSUSHO ASIA PACIFIC PTE LTD – Singapore  \\n**Jun 2015 - Apr 2017**\\n\\n### Demand and Supply Analyst, Automotive Division\\n- Overhauled formatting of sales planning files to become a centralised automated forecasting tool using VBA coding, and operational research forecasting techniques (exponential smoothing, holt-winters). The tool helped Toyota’s automotive distributors minimise stock overflows and improved accuracy of long-term sales forecasts by about 25%.\\n\\n# SELECTED ACADEMIC PROJECTS\\n\\n### You only edit once (Computer Vision) GitHub Link\\n*You only edit once is a video truncation and image wallpaper extraction tool for leisure divers, who only need to upload their diving videos to the YOEO app. The YOEO application was presented at a Computer Vision application competition and won 3rd place honors. YOEO was also conferred the title of ‘most investable project’ by the panel of judges.*\\n- Developed frame extraction algorithm to sample frames from personal and publicly available diving videos.\\n- Annotated objects of interest (fish, shark, etc.) with bounding boxes using Datuature’s annotation tools.\\n- Finetuned YOLOX and YOLOv5 object detection models. The best model yielded a mAP score of 0.377.\\n- Developed frame filtering algorithm to acquire frames with a sizeable number of objects of interest.\\n- Developed video stitching and audio stitching algorithm to stitch filtered frames into a movie.\\n- Developed wallpaper extraction algorithm. The algorithm selects the best n-frames, and for each frame, increases the percentage of red light, checks and adjusts for image brightness and sharpness, and adds an Instagram filter of choice.\\n- Developed user-friendly application interface using Streamlit to host model for inferences, allow users to upload a video and audio of their choice, specify configurations, and return final truncated video and wallpaper images.\\n\\n### Writing Singapore’s next national day song using AI (Natural Language Processing) GitHub Link\\n*This project aims to write Singapore’s next national day song (lyrics, vocals, melody and harmony) using AI. The project won 3rd place honors for the MITB 15th Anniversary Poster Competition*\\n- **Lyrics generation:** Developed deep learning language models of various architectures (Seq2Seq with attention, LSTM, GRU) for generation of song lyrics. Finetuned pre-trained transformer models such as GPT-2 using Singapore National Day songs to generate song lyrics.\\n- **Sentiment analysis:** Used VADER and GloVE to evaluate sentimentality of song lyrics, and used BLEU and ROUGE metrics to evaluate quality of developed songs. Incorporated sentiment into the loss function of neural networks and experimented with prompt engineering and sentimentality tagging methods to develop sentimental lyrics.\\n- **Melody generation:** Used pretrained AI music generative models to generate melody, harmony and vocals conditioned on song lyrics. The model was trained on lyrics and melody of known singers and songs.\\n- Developed custom loss function to ensure that lyrics generated reflect the sentiment of national day songs.\\n\\n### Developing Singapore’s Coffee Joint Recommendation System using Yelp Data (Recommender Systems) GitHub Link\\n\\n- Developed scraper using BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews of cafes on Yelp.com.\\n- Developed the following recommendation models:\\n  - **Explicit Data Handling:** Matrix Factorization & Weighted Matrix Factorization\\n  - **Multimodal Deep Learning Models:** Convolutional Matrix Factorization, & Collaborative Deep Learning. These models incorporate Convolution Network and Autoencoder aspects on textual reviews with matrix factorization.\\n  - **Context-Aware Models:** Factorization machines to account for context of items and users in recommendation.\\n  - **Explainable Recommendation Models (To factor in explanations as an aspect of recommendation models):**\\n    - Multi-Task Explainable Recommendation – a model operating on the Tucker Decomposition methodology.\\n\\n## Catching AI model backdoors (AI Systems Security) [GitHub Link]\\n*This project aims to discover hidden backdoors maliciously incorporated into AI models to influence results.*\\n- Developed the following algorithms to ascertain backdoored classes in models. The difference in inferencing results arising from these tests prove that a model has a backdoor for several classes.\\n  - **Neural attention distillation:** Finetuned teacher model to train student model to forget backdoors by minimizing mean-squared errors of attention maps on the feature vector and cross entropy loss.\\n  - **Gaussian noising and random neuron switching:** Added noise layer and randomly switched neurons off during finetuning to candidate model to cause it to forget backdoor triggers.\\n  - **Adversarial perturbation tests:** Developed minor perturbations (pixel changes, lighting changes, etc.) that should not change the model’s classification to identify if the model is robust to these perturbations. A backdoored model is sensitive to these perturbations for target classes.\\n- Developed neural cleansing algorithm to reverse engineer backdoors on AI models for validation.\\n\\n## The IoT Pipeline Monitoring System [Published Medium Article Link]\\n- Developed a sensorised IoT liquid pipeline monitoring system to detect pipe leaks in real-time using Python’s paho-mqtt library, gravity water pressure sensors and Arduino microcontrollers. The solution allows for remote monitoring of underground pipeline infrastructure without requiring engineers to be on-site.\\n\\n## CODING COMPETITION RESULTS\\n\\n### Recommender Systems Coding Competition (amongst fellow SMU Masters students in the AI program)\\n*Public Leaderboard Rank: 3rd place, Private Leaderboard Rank: 3rd place (user_id: hy.lin, competition page)*\\n- Developed a recommender system using gradient convolution network algorithms from anonymized user rating data.\\n\\n### Food Image Classification Competition (amongst fellow SMU Masters students in the AI program)\\n*Final Ranking: 1st place, no competition link*\\n- Developed and optimized convolution neural network models with convolution and fully-connected layers.\\n- Designed custom cross-entropy function to penalize some misclassifications more than others, ensuring that the consequences of misclassifications are minimized.\\n- The final model yielded a classification accuracy of 74.5% on unseen data.\\n\\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\n- **Technology Stack:**\\n  - Programming Languages: Python (primary), R, C#, VBA, MATLAB\\n  - Databases: SQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, TigerGraph, Redis\\n  - Programming Tools: Tableau, SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Visual Analytics, DataRobot\\n  - Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Snowflake, Cloudera\\n  - Linux: RedHat\\n\\n- **Open-source Contributions:**\\n  - Fixed a code bug in the LlamaIndex python library’s Gmail Tool. This patch was accepted and merged.\"}\u001b[00m\n",
